## Your First Morph: Tips for Success

Regardless of which platform you're using, here are some tips for getting the best results:

- **Start simple**: try "a wooden barrel" before "an ornate medieval castle with stained glass windows"
- **Image to 3D gives the best results**: if you have a reference image, use it
- **Enable the Simplify option**: it keeps your mesh game-ready with a reasonable face count
- **Request texture generation**: textures bring your model to life and show how it'll look in-game
- **Iterate**: morph the same prompt a few times to get variations, then pick your favourite

For detailed tips on writing effective prompts and getting the most out of each morph, see the [Prompt Engineering & Best Practices](features#prompt-engineering--best-practices) guide.
