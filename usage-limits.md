# Usage Limits

## Table of Contents
{: .no_toc }

- TOC
{:toc}

Lagomorph currently offers a free Beta that gives you access to all features with monthly usage limits. This page explains what those limits are and how to make the most of them.

---

## Current Free Beta

### Morph Generation Limits

You currently get **50 morphs per month** across all platforms (Lagomorph Web, Unity plugin, and Unreal Engine plugin).

Each morph counts as one generation request, whether it's:

- Image to 3D conversion
- Text to 3D generation

### Texture Generation Limits

You currently get **50 texture generations per month** across all platforms.

Texture generation is a separate step from mesh generation. After creating a 3D model, you can optionally request automatic material and texture generation. Each texture generation request counts toward this limit.

## Need More Morphs?

If you're hitting the monthly limit and need more generations, we'd love to hear from you:

- **Email us:** [hello@lagomorph.ai](mailto:hello@lagomorph.ai)
- **Join Discord:** [Discord community](https://discord.gg/RsNwwy3WCc)

We're actively working on **Lagomorph Pro**, which will offer increased limits and additional features. See [Lagomorph Pro](lagomorph-pro) for details.

## Making the Most of Your Morphs

To maximize the value of your monthly morphs:

### Prepare Before Morphing

- **Refine your prompts** before clicking generate. See [Prompt Engineering & Best Practices](features#prompt-engineering--best-practices) for tips
- **Use high-quality reference images** for Image to 3D. Clear, well-lit images produce better results
- **Start simple** before attempting complex models

### Use the Right Mode

- **Image to 3D produces the best results** and is the more mature feature
- **Text to 3D is in preview** - use it for exploration but expect more variation

### Iterate Wisely

- Generate multiple variations when exploring design options, but be strategic
- Save successful prompts and reference images for reuse
- Review the mesh before requesting texture generation

### Track Usage

- Current usage and limits are easily viewable in all platforms
