Lagomorph is an AI-powered 3D asset generation tool for game developers and game artists.
Users generate 3D models by uploading reference images (Image to 3D) or entering text prompts
(Text to 3D). Output formats include FBX (Unity) and OBJ (Unreal Engine, general use).
The tool handles mesh generation, optional texture generation, and UV mapping automatically.
Generation typically takes 2–5 minutes per model.
