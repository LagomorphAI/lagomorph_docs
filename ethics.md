# Best Practices & Ethics

## Our Philosophy

Lagomorph AI exists to empower game developers and artists, not to replace them.

We're game enthusiasts ourselves, and we built this tool because we believe AI should be a creative amplifier. It handles the tedious, time-consuming parts of 3D asset creation so you can focus on what actually makes your game special: your vision, your style, your creativity.

We see AI-generated assets as a **starting point**, not a finished product. The best results come when you use Lagomorph as part of your creative pipeline, morph a base model, then refine it, texture it, and make it truly yours. AI is a tool in your toolkit, like a more powerful version of a box modelling workflow. The creative decisions are still yours.

## Ethical Use Guidelines

The assets generated by the Lagomorph tool are owned by you, the user. You are free to use these assets in your projects, personal, commercial, or otherwise as you see fit.

However, you are also responsible for ensuring you use these assets in a legal and ethical way. Lagomorph AI does not bear legal responsibility for how generated assets are used.

### Recommended Practices

- **Use morphed assets as starting points**: refine and customise them to fit your project's art style
- **Don't infringe on existing IP**: avoid prompts that are designed to replicate copyrighted characters, logos, or trademarked designs
- **Be transparent when appropriate**: if your project credits tools and assets, consider mentioning AI assistance
- **Respect the creative community**: AI is a tool that works alongside artistic skill, not a shortcut around it

### What We Process
