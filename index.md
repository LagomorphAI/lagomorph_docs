Lagomorph turns images and text prompts into game-ready 3D models, ready to import into Unity, Unreal Engine, Blender, and other 3D tools. Generate props, weapons, furniture, vehicles, and architecture in 2–5 minutes. Export as FBX (Unity) or OBJ (Unreal Engine, Blender). Available free via browser or as native editor plugins.

## Who Uses Lagomorph?

### Game Artists

Skip the tedious parts of 3D modeling and focus on what matters: **creativity**. Generate models from reference images or prompts, then add your artistic touches in your preferred 3D editor. Use Lagomorph to accelerate your asset pipeline and spend more time on creative decisions.

### Game Developers

Turbo-boost prototyping and content generation. Get placeholder assets instantly, test gameplay concepts faster, and focus on what makes your game unique. Whether you're solo developing or leading a team, Lagomorph gives you production-quality 3D assets without the production timeline.
