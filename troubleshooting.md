# Troubleshooting & FAQs

**Are there any usage limits?**
Users can enter up to 50 morph request per month. If you wish to do more morphs please reach out to us as hello@lagomorph.ai

**Why is the asset quality between different morph methods**
The current image to 3D generation uses methods that output things in what is our 'standard' quality. Text to 3D is still currently experimental and we're still looking to gather information on how desired this generation method is. For this reason Text to 3D still uses a lower & cheaper to run method. Improvements to Text to 3D can be expected soon on the free tier and will be available on paid tiers

**Why are my models gray?**
By default generated meshes don't have materails added. Materials can be added as a post-generation step 

## Common Issues

## Performance Tips
- Unless you really want a complex mesh, you should typically generate things with the 'simply' option on
- Our current focus is on generating inorganic game elements. You will get better quality results generating inorganic objects 

## Known Limitations
- Waiting times on the free tier may vary based on current system load
